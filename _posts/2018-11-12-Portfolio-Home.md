**Notebook:** [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oliver-ong/oliver-ong.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/mlp_mnist.ipynb)\\
**Dataset:** [MNIST database](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-identify-the-digits/)\\
**Description:** Implementation of a feed-forward neural network using Tensorflow. The model is trained and tested on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset (pretty much a pre-requisite for training deep learning models). \\
**Methods/concepts:** tensorflow, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), EDA (exploratory data analysis), neural network


## Graduate work

### Least squares regression using harmonic functions 
<center><img src= "\images\ls_harmonic.png" height = "400"></center>\\
**Notebook:** [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oliver-ong/oliver-ong.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/ls_harmonic.ipynb)\\
**Dataset:** [Government of Canada - Historical Climate Data](http://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html)\\
**Description:** Produces a least squares regression model by fitting a 9-parameter harmonic (trigonometric) function. This regression fits the minimum and maximum temperature data measured at the International Edmonton Airport between 1963 and 1993. Notebook covers pre-processing steps of the data and implementation of the model. \\
**Methods/concepts:** least squares regression, harmonic functions, periodicity modelling

### Least squares regression using compact-support basis functions

**Notebook:** [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oliver-ong/oliver-ong.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/ls_basis_compact.ipynb)\\
**Dataset:** [Solar 2000 Model](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/solar/solaruv.html)\\
**Description:** Produces a least squares regression model by fitting pre-defined basis functions (a piecewise cubic polynomial). This model uses solar flux data ( was generated such that the output as well as its first derivative is fitted exactly, preventing unwanted oscillations generated by sharp variations in the data.\\
**Methods/concepts:** least squares regression, basis functions, compact support

### Review of finite-difference schemes for the heat-diffusion equation 
<center><img src= "\images\mesh.png" width = "400"></center>\\
**Paper:** [[PDF]](\Papers\Heat-diffusion - Review of finite-difference schemes.pdf)\\
**Description:** The heat-diffusion equation is a second-order partial differential equation that governs the distribution of heat or diffusing material. This paper reviews some of the many finite-approximation schemes using for solving this equation and provides comparisons on their accuracy and stability. \\
**Methods/concepts:** finite-difference, temperature modelling, stability analysis, eigenvalue solutions
